# David Levi

David Levi was a writer and publisher of Jewish works in eighteenth-century Britain. Little is known of his personal life. He is the first translator of the Torah (the Five Books of Moses) from Hebrew into English, publishing a bilingual edition in 1785. He also translated the siddur, or prayer book, into English. His siddur was based on the rite of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, the dominant Jewish community in England in the late eighteenth century. He was also an avid polemicist, writing letters to Thomas Paine in defense of the Jewish Bible, a series of treatises on prophecies and the Jewish understanding of the messiah, and a book on the Hebrew language.
